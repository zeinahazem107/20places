        <p>Also in Italy is The Leaning Tower of Pisa, another commonly visited site located in Pisa, Italy. Known as Torre Pendente di Pisa in Italian, it is different than most medieval architecture. It is important to mention how this tower's design is significant.Originally designed to be a bell tower, the tower actually stood upright for over 5 years, but just after the completion of the third floor it began to lean. The citizens of Italy were shocked as it began to lean ever so slightly. The Leaning Tower is the third oldest building on Pisa's Piazza del Duomo (cathedral square).</p>
